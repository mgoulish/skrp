Latency Under Load
------------------------------------

This test starts a router with two TCP channels 
through it.  ( I.e. two TCP listeners and two 
connectors, each listener-connector pair using a 
separate address. )

In one TCP stream, use iperf3 to generate a lot of
load.

In the other stream, use sockperf to do a ping-pong
latency test.

This test is fully automated, all the way to 
producing a graph and displaying it.
