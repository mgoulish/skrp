What Is This Test?
--------------------------------------------------
Two-router network with iperf3 sender and receiver.
The test has many separate runs to measure throughput
with different numbers of router threads, sender 
threads, and routerCPU allocation.

At the end, a result graph is presented for each
CPU allocation, showing routher threads on the X-axis
and sender threads on the Y-axis.



--------------------------------------------------
How to run it
--------------------------------------------------
Do ./r in this directory to run the test.

Look at the ./r script to see a shorter version,
commented out.



--------------------------------------------------
What it Does
--------------------------------------------------

It will run a whole bunch of tests with 
different settings for:

   * number of parallel iperf sender threads

   * number of router threads

   * amount of CPU allocated to each router

And it will run each test several times and
when it processes the results those iterations
will be averaged.

When the test is done, it will run ./process_results

The process_results program will produce a graph showing 
how throughput varied across different number of threads 
and different CPU allocations.



--------------------------------------------------
System Requirements
--------------------------------------------------
You need gnuplot and some ffmpeg tools installed.
run_test.py will let you know if it can't find the 
programs it needs.
