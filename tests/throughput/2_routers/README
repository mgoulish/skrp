First, do ./run_test   .

No, wait.

First *look* at ./run_test and see if you want 
to change and of the user-settable parameters 
at the top.

It will run a whole bunch of tests with 
different settings for:

   * number of parallel iperf sender threads

   * amount of CPU allocated to each router

And it will run each test several times and
when you process the results those iterations
will be averaged.



When the test is done, you run ./process_results

It will produce a graph showing how throughput 
varied across different number of threads and
diffrent CPU allocations.


./run_process_results uses ./process_results.py
